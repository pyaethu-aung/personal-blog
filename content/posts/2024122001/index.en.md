## Introduction
`([A-Za-z])\w+\s+\W\D`  
When you come across a regular expression like that, chances are a lot of programmers (myself included) have no clue what it means at first glance. And when it’s time to write a regex for validation, most of us probably head straight to [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) or [regex101](https://regex101.com/). These days, though, we’ve got tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to help out.

While taking a data-related course, I came across regular expressions. So, I decided to write this post as a way to help myself remember them. Even though this post uses Python for examples, the concepts of regular expressions are pretty much the same across other programming languages too.
