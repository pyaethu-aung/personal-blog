It's been almost a year since my last blog post, which was back in January. I've been busy with personal things and also just feeling lazy.

Recently, I decided to try out [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and also wanted to write a small CLI app to calculate personal income tax in Myanmar. That led to the [PIT calculator CLI app](https://github.com/pyaethu-aung/myanmar-pit-calculator). You can try it with both a simple CLI interface and a TUI interface. With the help of Copilot, I managed to write a proper README, so I encourage you to check it out if you have a chance. I still need to add features for life insurance, other tax exemptions, bonuses, and other taxable income types.
